The two projects in this repo replicate the Parameters validation issue in the Firely.Fhir.Validation.Validator. The `firely-validator-api-current` project uses the new Firely.Fhir.Validation.Validator class which does not properly generate an OperationOutcome with an error, and the `firely_validator_api_legacy` project uses the legacy Hl7.Fhir.Validation.Validator class. Both projects have a single unit test that use a simple Parameters resource and illustrate the validation issue. The issue has been drafted here https://github.com/FirelyTeam/firely-validator-api/issues/399
